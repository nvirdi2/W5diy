Reflection
This workshop was focus on different types of operators and how they can be used during the program that was
being created. To start, binary member operators are used for overloading. This concept of how to declare them 
was very easy since it was very similar to how we declare functions, just with a symbol in between. For example, 
in the "Account.h" file one of the binary member operators such as, "Account& operator <<(Account& account);". 
It was not too hard to create a function on the inside of it too since it was just like the time when I create a normal
, not an overload function. To continue, in the lab there was a unary function that was created. This was a little
easy, just to understand what it does. I understood that it takes one argument, however, it was easier to create because 
it was just one argument being returned. In this lab and DIY, the was type conversion operators and they were used convert 
to different types like int, double, from a bool. Then lastly, we had helper operators that were in between classes and
had types. This was probably the concept I had to revisit many times throughout this whole workshop just because I 
needed to understand the concept well and not just type it all out. The creation of the helpers was easy but understanding
why there are there and what they do was probably the hardest concept of this whole workshop. Yet, this was not too hard compared
to other labs I had before in this class.
